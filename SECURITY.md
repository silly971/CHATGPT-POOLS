## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.

- Preferred: use GitHub Security Advisories (if this repository is hosted on GitHub).
- Otherwise: contact the maintainers privately with a minimal reproduction and impact description.

Do not include secrets (API keys, tokens, cookies, or `.env` contents) in any report.
